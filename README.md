# DeeppLearning
In order to achieve the objective of the project, two different tools obtained from two GitHub repositories have been used.
- [Ask2transformers](https://github.com/osainz59/Ask2Transformers): we clon the repository because we edit a2t/base.py script inserting the function that we use.
- [Promptsource](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/promptsource): we install using ```pip install promptsource```.
